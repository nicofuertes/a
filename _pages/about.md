**About me**

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on health economics and economics of education using applied econometrics.

Prior to joining UCSB, I worked at the Office of the Manager of the Social Sector at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington D.C. where I conducted research on labor markets and economics of education. I was also the Data Center Coordinator at the School of Economics of the Universidad de los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia.
